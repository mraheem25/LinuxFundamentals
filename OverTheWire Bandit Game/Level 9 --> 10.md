# Level 9 --> 10

## Task 
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.

## Solution 1

1. `strings data.txt | grep "====="`
   - `strings` finds human readable strings and prints them. This command is necessary as this file has a lot of non-printable characters
   - `grep` for `=====` among the readable strings and highlights them
