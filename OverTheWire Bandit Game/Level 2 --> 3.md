# Level 2 --> 3

## Task
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `--spaces in this filename--`located in the home directory

## Solution
1. `ls`
   - List contents of current directory
3. `cat "--spaces in this filename--"`
   - Prints contents of file
   - Filename has to be contaiend within a string ("") to prevent `cat` interpreting the filename as four separate files (spaces, in, this, filename)
