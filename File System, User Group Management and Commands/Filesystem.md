# Linux Filesystem

The linux filesystem is based on a hierarchical structure with the root directory (`/`) at the top. All other directories branch off from the root directory

There are several directories that make up the linux filesystem. Commonly used directories are listed below:

`/bin` - Essential command binaries
  - Can be considered as the system dictionary
  - The files within this directory are used help the system understand the commands being made.

`/home` - User home directory
  - Where all the users live and contains personal directories for each user

`/tmp` - Temporary files
  - Temporary storage area for files, which exist for the duration of the session. This directory is emptied when the system is rebooted

`/boot` - System boot loader files
  - Contains all files that are related to the booting process

`/etc` - Host-specific system-wide configuration and shell scripts
  - Contains system configuration files
