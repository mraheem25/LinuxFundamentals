# Terminal & Shells

A terminal is the command line interface that allows you to interact with the operating system by enetering commands.

Terminal uses include:
 - Navigating through the filesystem
 - Installing and configurating software
 - Performing administrative tasks

The shell is a user interface that provides access to the operating system (OS) services. The shell is a layer between the user and the core of the OS, which translates commands into actions.

When we enter commands into the terminal, we are communicating with the OS through the shell. The shell takes the command and produces an output.

There are different types of shells, each having their own features and capabilities. However, they all serve the same fundamental purpose which is to help us interact with the OS

Types of Shells:
 - Bash (Bourne Again Shell) 
 - Csh/Tcsh 
 - Ksh
 - Zsh
   - Popular due to being highly customisable
   - Inludes features such as auto-completion and spell correction
 - Fish
