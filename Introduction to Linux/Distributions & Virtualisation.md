# Linux Virtualisation

### Virtualisation allows you to run linux on your existing computer without needing to replace the operating system

In order to install Ubuntu:
- Mac users would need to install UTM from https://mac.getutm.app/
- Window users would need to install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/

An alternative method would be to rent a virtual machine from AWS, which can be accessed from your computer's terminal. This is done by launching and connecting to an EC2 Instance.
